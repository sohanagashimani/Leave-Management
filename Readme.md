<h1>Leave management</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a “Leave management system” software used to manage and maintain leaves
taken by the employees in an institution</li>
<li>This application has 3 level hierarchy (Principal/Admin, Hod, Staff) along with
probation and regular staff</li>
<li>Admin creates the staff of the institution</li>
<li>A user can create a leave and mention the multiple substitute staff for the day/days he is
on leave.
</li>
<li>It gets accepted or declined based on the hierarchy.</li>
<li>The request goes to the Hod/admin only if it is accepted by all the mentioned substitute
staff.</li>
<li>The user can view his leave details on his home page where he can see who has accepted
and who is yet to accept / decline his/her leave.</li>
<li>The user can view his profile and see all the details like leaves remaining, his joining
date and etc.</li>
<li>The entire application is email automated, i.e. Every user gets a mail popup for
acceptance/denial of his/her leave request as well as when there is a new request from
other staff. </li>
<li>The entire application has proper form validations, user interactive alerts using react-toastify and is a single page application which gives a better user experience as it does
not require page reloading during use.</li>
<li>This application is fully responsive so that users can use it on any type of device.</li>
<li>The database of this system is hosted on cloud so any super user with correct credentials
can access the database from anywhere.</li>
